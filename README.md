Data professional survey for employees

Data cleaning: 
•	Remove the unwanted columns first.
•	Split the title column by delimiter as (, it will create a separate column and later you can remove the unwanted one.
•	Split the data programing column by delimiter as colon:
•	Clear the current yearly salary column by breaking up the numbers and taking average (as the given data is in range, we will get sum common number). We will create a duplicate column and apply split on digit to non-digit. For column with k remove it and for column with k – and number replace the k – with blank.
Create a Average salary column by adding customized column.
•	Similarly clean the data for country and industry you work.
